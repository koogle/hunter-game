  "customScenario": "In the heart of an ancient, uncharted forest known as Valenwood, whispers of a once-mighty kingdom echo through the thick canopy of emerald leaves. The Lost Kingdom of Eldoria, as it was called, is said to have thrived centuries ago, its splendor rivaling that of the sun itself, before mysteriously vanishing from the annals of history. As your party steps deeper into the forest, the air grows thick with a magical mist that seems to shimmer under the light of the sun, revealing glimpses of crumbling stonework and overgrown archways entwined with vibrant moss and wildflowers. The path beneath your feet is strewn with ancient runes, half-concealed by the roots of giant trees, each step sparking a faint glow and an echo of forgotten incantations.\n\nAt the heart of Valenwood lies the fabled Eldorian Crystal, a source of immense power said to be embedded within the ruins of the royal palace. Surrounding the palace are remnants of the kingdom’s grandeur: majestic statues of forgotten heroes, their faces worn but resolute, and sprawling gardens where the once vibrant flora has become a canvas of nature’s reclamation. Darkened shadows flit between the trees, hinting at lurking dangers—mythical beasts, enchanted guardians of the realm, and the restless spirits of Eldoria’s last defenders. As night falls, the forest comes alive with ethereal lights and haunting melodies, beckoning adventurers to uncover the kingdom’s secrets, confront the malevolent force that caused its demise, and perhaps even bring a flicker of its lost glory back to life. Will your party uncover the truth hidden within the ruins, or will Eldoria’s mysteries claim yet another set of souls? The Lost Kingdom awaits your exploration, filled with promise and peril alike.",

The forest is alive with a gentle, rhythmic hum, as if the trees themselves are breathing with you. Sunbeams filter through the emerald canopy above, catching the motes of magical mist and scattering shifting patterns of light across the ground.\n\nThe air feels thick with ancient secrets. Somewhere in the distance, a haunting melody—half-birdsong, half-echo of a long-forgotten flute—drifts through the underbrush. For a moment, the only sound nearby is your own breathing, and the occasional rustle of unseen creatures moving through the leaves.\n\nAs you sit, you notice that the runes around your resting place glow a little brighter. A faint warmth travels up through the stone, tingling beneath your skin. You sense, deep within your bones, the presence of something watching—curious, yet cautious.\n\nA gentle breeze stirs the wildflowers at your feet. One blossom, blue as the twilight sky, seems to lean toward you, its petals trembling as if in greeting or warning.\n\nWhat will you do next?",
