  "customScenario": "In the heart of an ancient, uncharted forest known as Valenwood, whispers of a once-mighty kingdom echo through the thick canopy of emerald leaves. The Lost Kingdom of Eldoria, as it was called, is said to have thrived centuries ago, its splendor rivaling that of the sun itself, before mysteriously vanishing from the annals of history. As your party steps deeper into the forest, the air grows thick with a magical mist that seems to shimmer under the light of the sun, revealing glimpses of crumbling stonework and overgrown archways entwined with vibrant moss and wildflowers. The path beneath your feet is strewn with ancient runes, half-concealed by the roots of giant trees, each step sparking a faint glow and an echo of forgotten incantations.\n\nAt the heart of Valenwood lies the fabled Eldorian Crystal, a source of immense power said to be embedded within the ruins of the royal palace. Surrounding the palace are remnants of the kingdom’s grandeur: majestic statues of forgotten heroes, their faces worn but resolute, and sprawling gardens where the once vibrant flora has become a canvas of nature’s reclamation. Darkened shadows flit between the trees, hinting at lurking dangers—mythical beasts, enchanted guardians of the realm, and the restless spirits of Eldoria’s last defenders. As night falls, the forest comes alive with ethereal lights and haunting melodies, beckoning adventurers to uncover the kingdom’s secrets, confront the malevolent force that caused its demise, and perhaps even bring a flicker of its lost glory back to life. Will your party uncover the truth hidden within the ruins, or will Eldoria’s mysteries claim yet another set of souls? The Lost Kingdom awaits your exploration, filled with promise and peril alike.",

      "content": "The mist-shrouded forest of Valenwood envelops you in a tapestry of green and gold. Ancient trees, their trunks thick as castle towers, rise high above, their leafy crowns weaving a living ceiling that filters sunlight into dappled emerald patterns at your feet. The air is fragrant with moss, wildflowers, and the lingering sweetness of something old and magical.\n\nBeneath your boots, a narrow path snakes through the undergrowth, its stones carved with faded runes that flicker faintly as you pass. Tangled roots reach out like gnarled fingers, half-hiding fragments of crumbled masonry—evidence of structures long abandoned. Here and there, glimpses of carved pillars and archways peek through the foliage, draped in vines and shy blue blossoms.\n\nTo your left, a statue of a forgotten hero stands half-swallowed by ivy, sword raised in silent defiance. To your right, the forest thickens, shadows shifting as if something unseen trails your steps. The gentle murmur of a nearby stream mingles with the distant, haunting notes of a melody that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.\n\nAhead, the path forks: one way curves deeper into the heart of the ruins, where the mist glows with a faint, otherworldly light; the other veers toward the sound of running water, promising a brief respite and perhaps something more. Behind you, the forest closes in—returning would be no simple task.\n\nThe kingdom’s secrets whisper from every stone and shadow. Where will you go?",

The ancient runes beneath your feet pulse once with a gentle light, as if acknowledging your presence. The air is thick with the scent of earth and blooming things, and the ambient magic of the forest seems to settle around you like a cloak.\n\nAs you rest, the sounds of the forest grow clearer. The distant melody drifts closer, weaving with the chirr of insects and the soft rustle of leaves. Somewhere nearby, a bird calls—a strange, mournful note that echoes through the trees. The running water to your right gurgles over smooth stones, an invitation to refresh yourself if you choose.\n\nFor a moment, you simply exist in this place between worlds, the weight of the forest’s history pressing in on you from all sides. A faint breeze stirs the leaves and carries with it the whisper of voices, just beyond comprehension—stories of the past, secrets of Eldoria waiting to be uncovered.\n\nIn the stillness, you notice a glimmer in the undergrowth just ahead, as if something reflective is half-buried among the wildflowers and roots. The forked paths still await your decision, but now there’s this small, curious glint so close at hand.\n\nWhat will you do next?",

      "content": "You sit quietly, letting your senses stretch out into the misty hush. The magic-laden air seems to resonate with your curiosity, and suddenly, details that might have escaped a casual glance sharpen into focus.\n\nThe glimmer in the undergrowth catches your attention first. Peering closer, you discern not just a random shine, but the edge of a small, intricately etched metal object half-buried in the roots and wildflowers—a pendant, perhaps, or a fragment of something once important. Faint symbols—similar to the runes along the path—are visible on its surface, suggesting it could be a piece of Eldorian craftsmanship.\n\nThe statue to your left, previously just a mossy sentinel, now reveals more: the hero’s armor bears a sigil—a stylized sunburst entwined with what looks like a crystal. The way the vines curl around the statue’s sword draws your eyes downward, where you notice a nearly hidden inscription in Old Eldorian script, the words softly aglow with magic:  \n*\"Where the waters mirror the sky,  \nThe lost heart’s answer lies.\"*\n\nTo your right, the sound of running water becomes more distinct. With a moment’s concentration, you deduce the stream is not natural; the stones lining its banks are clearly shaped by hand, forming a barely visible channel that leads deeper into the ruins. Here and there, the water reflects not just sunlight, but fleeting images—faces, perhaps, or memories—dancing on its surface before fading away.\n\nThe fork in the path remains, but with your keen assessment, you now see subtle patterns in the way the mist gathers: the path toward the glowing ruins pulses with magical energy, while the way toward the water feels charged with something older and quieter—maybe even a protective ward.\n\nThe forest holds its breath, awaiting your choice. Will you investigate the glimmering object, study the statue and its inscription further, or follow one of the paths now revealed in new light?",
