    "Welcome, Jakob!",
    "Your adventure begins in: The Lost Kingdom",
    "hello",
    "Greetings, Jakob! Your journey into the heart of The Lost Kingdom begins now. As you stand at the edge of the ancient, overgrown ruins, the air is thick with the scent of moss and the distant sound of trickling water echoes through the crumbling stone arches.\n\nBefore you lies a path leading deeper into the ruins, shrouded in mystery and danger. To your right, a small, clear stream cuts through the undergrowth, possibly leading to a different part of the kingdom. And to your left, a faint trail seems to wind up towards what might once have been a watchtower.\n\nWhat will you do, Jakob? Will you follow the path into the heart of the ruins, explore along the stream, or investigate the trail leading to the watchtower?",
    "I will sit on the ground",
    "As you settle onto the cool, moss-covered ground, taking a moment to rest and gather your thoughts, the world around you seems to slow. The distant sound of the trickling water becomes more pronounced, a soothing melody amidst the ruins. The air, heavy with the scent of earth and ancient stone, wraps around you like a cloak.\n\nWhile you sit, you notice small details you hadn't before: tiny insects buzzing around the wildflowers that have claimed the cracks in the stone, and the way the sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dappled shadows on the path ahead.\n\nAfter a few moments of contemplation, you feel more attuned to your surroundings. The path into the ruins still beckons, the stream to your right continues its gentle flow, and the trail to the left still winds up towards the watchtower.\n\nWhat will you do next, Jakob? Will you continue to rest, or have you decided on a direction to explore?",
    "test",
    "As you sit on the ground, testing the feel of the earth beneath you, you notice a slight vibration, almost imperceptible. It could be the natural settling of the ancient ruins, or perhaps something else stirring deep within the kingdom.\n\nThe path into the ruins, the stream to your right, and the trail leading to the watchtower remain your options. What will you do next, Jakob?",
    "I check out the grass",
    "You sift your fingers through the verdant, dew-kissed blades of grass that carpet the ground of the Lost Kingdom. You notice a variety of wildflowers tangled in the greenery, their colors a stark contrast to the ancient, gray stones of the ruins. \n\nAs you investigate, you notice an odd, tiny, silver-blue flower standing out amidst the sea of green. It gleams faintly, providing a gentle, magical glow. Its presence could be a sign of something. Would you pick it up or leave it be?",
    "I want to pick it up",
    "As you reach down to pick the silver-blue flower, you feel a magical warmth emanating from it. It seems to pulse softly with a gentle light. \n\nYou carefully pluck the flower, its glow accentuating amidst the surrounding greenery. This seemingly enchanted flower is now yours. It feels strangely comforting, bringing a sense of tranquility.\n\nWith the magical flower secure, you gaze again at the path leading to the heart of the ruins, the stream cutting through the undergrowth, and the faint trail extending towards the watchtower. Where do you choose to explore next, Jakob?",
    "I put the flower in my inventory",
    "You tuck the glowing, silver-blue flower safely into your inventory. As you secure it, you canâ€™t help but wonder what mysteries it might unlock down the line.\n\nWith the flower secure, you return your attention to your surroundings. The ruins to your front, the stream to your right, and the trail to the watchtower on your left wait quietly for your decision. \n\nWhat do you choose to explore next, Jakob?",
    "what is my inventory right nwo",
    "Currently, your inventory contains:\n\n1. A silver-blue flower: A magical and warm flower that you found in the grass. It radiates a gentle light.\n\nYou have ample space for other objects that you may find during your adventure in The Lost Kingdom. What would you like to do next, Jakob?"
