    "Welcome, Jakob!",
    "Your adventure begins in: The Lost Kingdom",
    "hello",
    "Greetings, Jakob! Your journey into the heart of The Lost Kingdom begins now. As you stand at the edge of the ancient, overgrown ruins, the air is thick with the scent of moss and the distant sound of trickling water echoes through the crumbling stone arches.\n\nBefore you lies a path leading deeper into the ruins, shrouded in mystery and danger. To your right, a small, clear stream cuts through the undergrowth, possibly leading to a different part of the kingdom. And to your left, a faint trail seems to wind up towards what might once have been a watchtower.\n\nWhat will you do, Jakob? Will you follow the path into the heart of the ruins, explore along the stream, or investigate the trail leading to the watchtower?",
    "I will sit on the ground",
    "As you settle onto the cool, moss-covered ground, taking a moment to rest and gather your thoughts, the world around you seems to slow. The distant sound of the trickling water becomes more pronounced, a soothing melody amidst the ruins. The air, heavy with the scent of earth and ancient stone, wraps around you like a cloak.\n\nWhile you sit, you notice small details you hadn't before: tiny insects buzzing around the wildflowers that have claimed the cracks in the stone, and the way the sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dappled shadows on the path ahead.\n\nAfter a few moments of contemplation, you feel more attuned to your surroundings. The path into the ruins still beckons, the stream to your right continues its gentle flow, and the trail to the left still winds up towards the watchtower.\n\nWhat will you do next, Jakob? Will you continue to rest, or have you decided on a direction to explore?"
